The religious act which Barney and his friends hold most sacred,
 XORING the natural numbers in the given range. 
 This time Barney is a bit busy with picking up some girls,
  so he asked you to help him. He gave you two numbers L and R,
   you have to find if XOR of all the numbers in range L to R (L,R both inclusive) is odd or even.

Input:

    The first line will contain T, number of testcases.
    Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers L,R.

Output:
    For each testcase, in the new line print "Odd" if the XOR in the range is odd, else print "Even".
