Binary Search

In this section, we will implementing a binary Search 
    using recursion. This algorithms has two attributes:
    low and high where low = 0 and high = n-1. The median
    candiate is found as follows:
        mid = (low + high)/2
    
    Then we take in consideration the following three cases:
        1- If the target equals data[mid], then we're done :D
        2- If target < data[mid], then we recur on the firt half
            of the sequence, that is, on the interval of indices from 
            low to mid - 1.
        3- If target > data[mid], then we recur on the second half
            of the sequence, e.i., on the interval of indices from 
            mid + 1 to high.
This algorithm is O(log(n)) whenever the sequence is sorted... using an 
    unsorted sequence, we'd probably use asequenceial search... taking O(n)search.
